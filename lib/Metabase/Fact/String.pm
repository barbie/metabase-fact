=head1 NAME

Metabase::Fact::String - fact subtype for simple strings

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # defining the fact class
  package MyFact;
  use base 'Metabase::Fact::String';

  sub content_metadata {
    my $self = shift;
    return {
      'size' => [ '//num' => length $self->content ],
    };
  }

  sub validate_content {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::validate_content;
    die __PACKAGE__ . " content length must be greater than zero\n"
      if length $self->content < 0;
  }

  # using the fact class
  my $fact = MyFact->new(
    resource => 'RJBS/Metabase-Fact-0.001.tar.gz',
    content => "Hello World",
  );

  $client->send_fact($fact);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base class for facts that are just strings of text.  Strings must be characters,
not bytes.

=head1 USAGE

[Talk more about how to subclass...]

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 Set during construction 

=head3 required (required)

The canonical CPAN ID the Fact relates to.  For distributions, this is the 
'AUTHOR/Distname-Version.Suffix' form used to install specific distributions
with CPAN.pm -- for example, 'TIMB/DBI-1.604.tar.gz' for the DBI distribution.

=head3 content (required)

A reference to the actual information associated with the fact.
The exact form of the content is up to each Fact class to determine.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Provided by this class

=head3 content_as_bytes()

=head3 content_from_bytes()

=head3 validate_content()

=head2 To be implemented by subclasses

=head3 content_metadata() (required)

=head3 validate_content() (optional)
